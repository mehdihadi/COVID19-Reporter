## Current basic condition
<font size="3">
The basic reproduction number, $R_0$, is the expected number of new infections from a single infection in a population where all subjects are susceptible. The estimated basic reproduction number is **1.73**. The typical time between contacts and the estimated incubation period are **2.64** and **7.09** days, respectively. The typical time for an infected individual to recover is **4.39** days. At the current condition which represent a **88.48** % social contacts for **101.69** % of population, it is expected that on **2020-09-23** the basic number of confirmed cases (I.b) will reach its peak number of **2272301** cases.

* **Note**: It should be noticed that there are limitations to the analyses performed, including uncertainties around estimates of $R_0$ and and other parameters.
